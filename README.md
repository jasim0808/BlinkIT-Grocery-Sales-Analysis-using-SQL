Cleaned the Item_Fat_Content column using UPDATE and CASE.
Calculated total and average sales using SUM and AVG.
Used GROUP BY and ORDER BY for grouped analysis.
Applied PIVOT to compare Low Fat vs Regular item sales.
Analyzed data based on outlet type, location, and establishment year.
# Tools & Skills

Aggregate functions: SUM(), AVG(), COUNT().
Filtering, grouping, sorting.
Basic data transformation and pivoting.
# Files Included
